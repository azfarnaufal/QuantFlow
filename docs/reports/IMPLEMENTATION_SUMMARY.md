- ✅ **Reinforcement Learning Strategy**: Created [reinforcement-strategy.js](file:///Users/azfar.naufal/Documents/projects/crypto-price-tracker/src/strategies/advanced-ml/reinforcement-strategy.js)
  - Q-learning based trading strategy
  - State representation with technical indicators (RSI, MACD)
  - Epsilon-greedy exploration policy

- ✅ **Ensemble Strategy**: Created [ensemble-strategy.js](file:///Users/azfar.naufal/Documents/projects/crypto-price-tracker/src/strategies/advanced-ml/ensemble-strategy.js)

  - Tab-based navigation for different analysis views

- ✅ **Strategy Performance Comparison Tools**: Enhanced server API
  - [/strategy/compare](file:///Users/azfar.naufal/Documents/projects/crypto-price-tracker/server.js#L373-L373) endpoint for comparing multiple strategies
  - Performance metrics calculation (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, etc.)
  - Visual comparison charts in dashboard

- ✅ **Correlation Analysis**: Enhanced server API
  - [/correlation](file:///Users/azfar.naufal/Documents/projects/crypto-price-tracker/server.js#L185-L185) endpoint for asset correlation analysis

## Scripts Created

1. **[deploy-staging.sh](file:///Users/azfar.naufal/Documents/projects/crypto-price-tracker/scripts/deploy-staging.sh)** - Automated staging deployment
2. **[validate-backtest.js](file:///Users/azfar.naufal/Documents/projects/crypto-price-tracker/scripts/validate-backtest.js)** - Backtesting validation against market performance
3. **[fine-tune-ml-models.js](file:///Users/azfar.naufal/Documents/projects/crypto-price-tracker/scripts/fine-tune-ml-models.js)** - ML model parameter optimization
4. **[advanced-dashboard.html](file:///Users/azfar.naufal/Documents/projects/crypto-price-tracker/public/advanced-dashboard.html)** - Interactive visualization dashboard

## Known Issues

1. **Network Connectivity**: The staging environment has issues connecting to Binance WebSocket API, likely due to Docker network restrictions or firewall settings. This prevents real-time data streaming but does not affect the core functionality of the implemented features.

2. **API Validation**: Due to the network connectivity issue, the validation scripts could not connect to the staging API to perform live testing.

## Next Steps

1. **Network Troubleshooting**: Investigate Docker networking configuration to resolve Binance WebSocket connectivity issues
2. **Live Testing**: Once connectivity is resolved, run the validation scripts to test against actual market performance
3. **ML Model Fine-tuning**: Use the fine-tuning script to optimize model parameters with historical data
4. **Production Deployment**: After successful validation, prepare for production deployment
