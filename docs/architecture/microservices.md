# Microservices Architecture

This document describes the proposed microservices architecture for QuantFlow, which breaks the monolithic application into smaller, independent services.

## Current Monolithic Architecture

The current QuantFlow application is a monolithic Node.js application that includes:

1. Price ingestion from Binance WebSocket
2. Data storage in TimescaleDB
3. Backtesting engine
4. Alerting system
5. REST API
6. Node-RED integration

## Proposed Microservices Architecture

### 1. Price Ingestion Service

**Responsibilities:**
- Connect to Binance WebSocket
- Receive real-time price updates
- Validate and preprocess data
- Publish price data to message queue

**Technology Stack:**
- Node.js with WebSocket client
- Redis Pub/Sub or RabbitMQ for messaging
- Docker container

**API Endpoints:**
- `/health` - Health check
- `/symbols` - Get list of tracked symbols
- `/subscribe/{symbol}` - Subscribe to a symbol
- `/unsubscribe/{symbol}` - Unsubscribe from a symbol

### 2. Storage Service

**Responsibilities:**
- Receive price data from message queue
- Store data in TimescaleDB
- Provide data access APIs
- Implement data retention policies

**Technology Stack:**
- Node.js with PostgreSQL client
- TimescaleDB
- Redis for caching
- Docker container

**API Endpoints:**
- `/health` - Health check
- `GET /prices` - Get latest prices for all symbols
- `GET /price/{symbol}` - Get latest price for a symbol
- `GET /history/{symbol}` - Get price history for a symbol
- `GET /ohlc/{symbol}` - Get OHLC data for charting
- `GET /symbols` - Get list of all tracked symbols

### 3. Backtesting Service

**Responsibilities:**
- Execute backtesting strategies
- Calculate performance metrics
- Store backtest results

- `POST /run` - Run a backtest
- `GET /results/{id}` - Get backtest results
- `GET /compare` - Compare multiple strategies

### 4. Alerting Service

**Responsibilities:**

- Generate alerts based on user-defined rules
- Send notifications via multiple channels
- Manage alert subscriptions

**Technology Stack:**

- Docker container

**API Endpoints:**
- `/health` - Health check
- `POST /alerts` - Create a new alert
- `GET /alerts` - Get all alerts
- `GET /alerts/{id}` - Get a specific alert
- `PUT /alerts/{id}` - Update an alert
- `DELETE /alerts/{id}` - Delete an alert

### 5. API Gateway

**Responsibilities:**
- Route requests to appropriate services
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Implement rate limiting
- Provide unified API documentation

**Technology Stack:**
- Express.js or NGINX
- JWT for authentication
- Docker container

**API Endpoints:**
- `/health` - Health check
- `/api/v1/price/*` - Route to Storage Service
- `/api/v1/backtest/*` - Route to Backtesting Service
- `/api/v1/alerts/*` - Route to Alerting Service

### 6. Node-RED Service

**Responsibilities:**
- Provide visual programming interface
- Integrate with QuantFlow services
- Enable custom workflow creation

**Technology Stack:**
- Node-RED
- Docker container

## Inter-Service Communication

### Message Queue

Services communicate asynchronously using a message queue:

- **Redis Pub/Sub** or **RabbitMQ** for real-time messaging
- **Apache Kafka** for high-throughput event streaming

### REST APIs

Services expose REST APIs for synchronous communication:

- **OpenAPI/Swagger** for API documentation
- **JSON** for data exchange
- **JWT** for authentication

## Data Flow

1. **Price Ingestion Service** receives real-time data from Binance
2. Price data is published to the message queue
3. **Storage Service** consumes price data and stores it in TimescaleDB
4. **Backtesting Service** retrieves historical data from Storage Service
5. **Alerting Service** monitors price conditions and sends notifications
6. **API Gateway** routes client requests to appropriate services
7. **Node-RED Service** provides visual integration capabilities

## Deployment Architecture

### Docker Compose

For local development and testing:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  # Message queue
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
  
  # Database
  timescaledb:
    image: timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg15
  
  # Microservices
  price-ingestion:
    build: ./price-ingestion
    depends_on:
      - redis
  
  storage:
    build: ./storage
    depends_on:
      - timescaledb
      - redis
  
  backtesting:
    build: ./backtesting
    depends_on:
      - storage
  
  alerting:
    build: ./alerting
    depends_on:
      - redis
  
  api-gateway:
    build: ./api-gateway
    depends_on:
      - price-ingestion
      - storage
      - backtesting
      - alerting
  
  nodered:
    image: nodered/node-red:latest
```

### Kubernetes

For production deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: price-ingestion
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: price-ingestion
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: price-ingestion
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: price-ingestion
        image: quantflow/price-ingestion:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: quantflow-config
```

## Benefits of Microservices Architecture

1. **Scalability**: Scale individual services based on demand
2. **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't affect others
3. **Technology Diversity**: Use different technologies for different services
4. **Deployment Flexibility**: Deploy and update services independently
5. **Team Scalability**: Different teams can work on different services
6. **Performance**: Optimize each service for its specific function

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Complexity**: Increased architectural complexity
2. **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication overhead
3. **Data Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across services
4. **Monitoring**: Need for distributed tracing and monitoring
5. **Testing**: More complex integration testing
6. **DevOps**: Requires robust CI/CD and deployment processes

## Migration Strategy

1. **Identify Service Boundaries**: Define clear boundaries for each service
2. **Extract Services**: Gradually extract services from the monolith
3. **Implement API Gateway**: Route traffic to appropriate services
4. **Migrate Data**: Move data to service-specific databases where appropriate
5. **Update Clients**: Update client applications to use new APIs
6. **Decommission Monolith**: Gradually decommission the monolithic application

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics

- Service-level metrics (latency, error rates, throughput)
- Business metrics (trades executed, alerts sent, backtests run)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage)

### Logging

- Centralized logging solution (ELK stack, Fluentd, etc.)
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Log aggregation and analysis

### Tracing

- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry or Jaeger
- End-to-end request tracking
- Performance bottleneck identification

## Security Considerations

1. **Service-to-Service Authentication**: Use mutual TLS or API keys
2. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt data in transit and at rest
3. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse at the API gateway level
5. **Vulnerability Management**: Regular security scanning of containers
