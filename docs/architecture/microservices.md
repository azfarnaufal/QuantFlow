# Microservices Architecture

## Overview

QuantFlow can be decomposed into several microservices to improve scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance. This document outlines the proposed microservices architecture.

## Microservices

### 1. Price Ingestion Service

**Responsibilities:**
- Connect to Binance WebSocket API
- Receive real-time price updates
- Validate and preprocess data
- Publish price data to message queue

**Technologies:**
- Node.js with WebSocket client
- Redis Pub/Sub or Apache Kafka for messaging
- Docker for containerization

**Endpoints:**
- WebSocket connection management
- Health check endpoint
- Metrics endpoint

### 2. Storage Service

**Responsibilities:**
- Persist price data to TimescaleDB
- Provide data access APIs
- Implement data retention policies
- Handle database connections and pooling

**Technologies:**
- Node.js with Express
- PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB
- Connection pooling
- Redis for caching

**Endpoints:**
- `/prices` - Get latest prices for all symbols
- `/price/{symbol}` - Get latest price for a symbol
- `/history/{symbol}` - Get price history for a symbol
- `/chart/ohlc/{symbol}` - Get OHLC data for charting
- `/indicators/{symbol}` - Get technical indicators for a symbol

### 3. Backtesting Service

**Responsibilities:**
- Execute trading strategy backtests
- Optimize strategy parameters
- Calculate performance metrics
- Manage backtest jobs

**Technologies:**
- Node.js with Express
- Strategy implementations
- Performance calculation algorithms
- Job queue for long-running tasks

**Endpoints:**
- `/backtest/strategies` - Get available strategies
- `/backtest/run` - Run a backtest
- `/backtest/optimize` - Optimize strategy parameters
- `/backtest/jobs/{jobId}` - Get backtest job status

### 4. Alerting Service

**Responsibilities:**
- Monitor price conditions
- Evaluate alert rules
- Send notifications via multiple channels
- Manage alert subscriptions

**Technologies:**
- Node.js with Express
- Notification providers (Telegram, Discord, Email)
- Rule evaluation engine
- Scheduler for periodic checks

**Endpoints:**
- `/alerts` - Manage alert rules
- `/alerts/subscriptions` - Manage alert subscriptions
- `/alerts/notifications` - Send test notifications

### 5. API Gateway

**Responsibilities:**
- Route requests to appropriate services
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Implement rate limiting
- Provide unified API documentation

**Technologies:**
- Express Gateway or NGINX
- JWT for authentication
- Rate limiting middleware
- Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation

**Endpoints:**
- All endpoints from other services
- Authentication endpoints
- Health check endpoints

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
- REST APIs for direct service-to-service communication
- GraphQL for complex queries spanning multiple services

### Asynchronous Communication
- Message queues (Redis Pub/Sub, Apache Kafka) for event-driven communication
- Event streaming for real-time data distribution

## Data Flow

1. **Price Ingestion Service** receives real-time data from Binance
2. Data is published to a message queue
3. **Storage Service** consumes the queue and persists data to TimescaleDB
4. **Backtesting Service** retrieves historical data for strategy analysis
5. **Alerting Service** monitors price conditions and sends notifications
6. **API Gateway** routes client requests to appropriate services

## Deployment Architecture

### Container Orchestration
- Docker containers for each service
- Docker Compose for local development
- Kubernetes for production deployment

### Service Discovery
- Kubernetes service discovery
- DNS-based service resolution

### Load Balancing
- Kubernetes internal load balancing
- External load balancer for public endpoints

### Monitoring and Logging
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- ELK stack for log aggregation

## Benefits of Microservices Architecture

1. **Scalability** - Each service can be scaled independently based on demand
2. **Fault Isolation** - Issues in one service don't affect others
3. **Technology Diversity** - Different services can use different technologies
4. **Team Autonomy** - Teams can work on different services independently
5. **Deployment Flexibility** - Services can be deployed independently
6. **Maintainability** - Smaller codebases are easier to understand and maintain

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1** - Separate Price Ingestion and Storage services
2. **Phase 2** - Extract Backtesting service
3. **Phase 3** - Extract Alerting service
4. **Phase 4** - Implement API Gateway
5. **Phase 5** - Add monitoring and logging infrastructure

## Configuration Management

Each service should have its own configuration management:
- Environment variables for deployment-specific settings
- Config maps in Kubernetes
- Centralized configuration service (optional)

## Security Considerations

- Service-to-service authentication
- API gateway handles external authentication
- Secure communication between services
- Regular security audits
